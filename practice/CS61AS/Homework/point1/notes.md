The Start
---------
I was trying to create the sum-of-squares function, and DrRacket didn't like what I put in, so I looked for more information.

[Racket Guide](http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/index.html)

Terminology
-----------
racket: The core compiler, interpreter, and run-time system

DrRacket: Programming Environment

raco: A command-line tool for executing RAcket COmmands (install, build)
