(relational programming: another name for logic programming, where relations are used)

(logic programming: A programming paradigm base on formal logic. Written in the style of a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.)

(macro: An extension to Scheme that allows programs to define and use new derived expression types.)

(relation: A function that returns a goal as its value)

Notes
=====
* Need to understand Scheme macros at level of let, and, and cond
* Two constants, {#s, #u}
* Three operators, {unify, fresh, conde}
* #s and #u resemble #t and #f
* fresh resembles lambda
* conde is syntactically like cond
* relations are named, ending in 'o'
* run is the interface to scheme

I was hoping to get set up similarly to Simply Scheme in Racket.
