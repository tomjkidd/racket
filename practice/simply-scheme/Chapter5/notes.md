Terms
-----
(symbols: ordinary words, ones that are neither strings nor numbers)
(selectors: take apart tools, like first)
(constructors: functions for putting things together)
(first-class data: words and sentences used as an example, as contrasted with numbers)

Notes
-----
* A sentence containing one word is different than the word itself, selectors operate on the two differently.
* (strings-are-numbers #t) is an extension to scheme that allows strings to be evaluated as numbers.
