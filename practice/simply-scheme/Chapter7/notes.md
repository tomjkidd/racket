Terms
-----
(variable: connection between a name and a value)
(named constant: constant, like use in mathematical formulas)
(local variable: the association of a formal parameter with an actual argument, name -> value)

Notes
-----
* Variable scoping described as little people hired out and looking at chalk boards.
* Formal parameters take precedence over global variables.
* let special form introduced. It takes two arguments:
    1. A sequence of name-value pairs enclosed in parentheses
    2. The body of the let expression to evaluate.
* Assignment is avoided to allow the substitution model to be used for reasoning.
