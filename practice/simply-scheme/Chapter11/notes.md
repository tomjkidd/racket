(recursion: solving a big problem by reducing it to a similar, smaller subproblem)
(combining method: create a method for solving the smallest problem, then the next smallest. Continue until a pattern can be established.)
(recursive case: procedure invokes itself with a smaller argument)
(base case: case that can be solved without calling the procedure recursively)
